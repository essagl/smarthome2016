A java port for the OpenHPI 2016 embedded Smarthome course.
The course took place from Monday, 06. June 2016, 08:00 (UTC) until Sunday, 10. Juli 2016, 12:00 (UTC) as an openHPI MOOC.<br>
You can recap the course in self-study at <a href="https://open.hpi.de/courses/smarthome2016">

<hr>
The programming examples in the course are all based on python. This project shows how to access the hardware using Java.<br>
You need the Board used during the course connected to an Raspberry PI, like shown in the course videos.<br>
Easiest way to get all running is to check out the sources, build and run directly on the Raspberry PI.<br>
Java 8 is needed to build all sources.<br>
